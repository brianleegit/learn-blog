#Machine Learning for humans<

Over the course of a few months, I've been researching the concepts and principles of machine learning. I've been researching neurons, backpropagation, classification, cross entropy, all of it. To a lot of people, including me a few months ago, all of this seems daunting, and insanely complex.

###Why is it so complicated?

##Machine learning researchers are massively pretentious##

^^ Yup. Machine learning is just another kind of programming. Albeit a cool one, but there's no rational reason to treat it as some mystical beast that only the chosen ones can tame.

Since I've been researching machine learning, alot of my fellow programmer buddies have been asking me how I understand all this crazy stuff. In actuality, the concepts are relatively simple. They're just termed incredibly unintuitively. Here's an example:

Say you walked up to me one random day and asked me what I was working on.

I could look up from my laptop and sneer and say "Oh, I'm training a *classification model* with two *input neurons*, a *hidden activation layer*, and a single *output neuron* using *backpropagation*"

You might think that's some fancy shit.

But in reality, that sentence, minus the pretentious terminology is "Oh, I'm teaching a program to take two lists of input, sort it, and guess what kind of thing it is. If it's wrong, it figures out where it went wrong, and tries again"

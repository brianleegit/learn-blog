# Lesson 01 - Neurons
## AKA - "What the frickity frackity hickity heckity is a neuron?"

![Earnest says "Yeah, my Neural Network uses a 3 dimensional input neuron vector, so what-". There is a list on a screen showing numbers 1,2, and 3. Ann asks Earnest "You mean that?"](http://img.hoff.in/learnest/svg/learnest0.svg)

## It's easier than you think

People in the machine learning industry love to throw around the word neuron.
And why shouldn't they? It's a great word. It brings to mind images of futuristic AIs that can think,
complicated neuroscience, and auspicious discoveries.

However, the use of it in machine learning is not only deceptive, but redundant. Machine learning documentation can often make more sense if you just remove the word neuron entirely.

For example:
"I'm feeding in two 3-dimensional input neurons"

Can easily become:
"I'm feeding in two 3-dimensional inputs"
